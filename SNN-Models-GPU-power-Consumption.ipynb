As such, the packages follow debian's patterns and often do not include a full python distribution with just `apt install python#.#`.  Here is a list of packages that may be useful along with the default install:\n","\n","- `python#.#-dev`: includes development headers for building C extensions\n","- `python#.#-venv`: provides the standard library `venv` module\n","- `python#.#-distutils`: provides the standard library `distutils` module\n","- `python#.#-lib2to3`: provides the `2to3-#.#` utility as well as the standard library `lib2to3` module\n","- `python#.#-gdbm`: provides the standard library `dbm.gnu` module\n","- `python#.#-tk`: provides the standard library `tkinter` module\n","\n","Third-Party Python Modules\n","==========================\n","\n","Python modules in the official Ubuntu repositories are packaged to work with the Python interpreters from the official repositories. Accordingly, they generally won't work with the Python interpreters from this PPA. As an exception, pure-Python modules for Python 3 will work, but any compiled extension modules won't.\n","\n","To install 3rd-party Python modules, you should use the common Python packaging tools.
